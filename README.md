This is a repo for my experiments with creating a ranking of Splatoon 3 players using the stat.ink data.

The appropriate virtual environment is the Anaconda environment
Splatoon3Rank

Note that you should use `conda` not `pip` for the environment.
Windows chokes because of the lack of a standard compiler if you use
`pip`.
