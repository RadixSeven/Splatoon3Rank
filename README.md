This is a repo for my experiments with creating a ranking of Splatoon 3 players using the stat.ink data.

The appropriate virtual environment is the Anaconda environment
Splatoon3Rank

Note that you should use `conda` not `pip` for the environment.
Windows chokes because of the lack of a standard compiler if you use
`pip`.

`battle-results-csv-schema.md` is copied from
the [`stat.ink` website](https://github.com/fetus-hina/stat.ink/wiki/Spl3-%EF%BC%8D-CSV-Schema-%EF%BC%8D-Battle)
